    <p>Hi, my name is Josie Sebald! I'm a cisgender woman and my pronouns are she/her. 
        I'm a 19 year old college junior at Michigan State University. 
        My major is in Games and Interactive Media, with a focus on animation. 
        I'm an artist, gamer, lover of music, and a supporter of LGBT+.
    </p>

        <br>
    <p>
        As an artist, I am currently accepting commissions! If you'd like to order a commission, payment can be made through:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paypal</li>
            <li>CashApp</li>
            <li>Venmo</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        I have experience in 3D design, 2D digital and traditional art (drawing and painting), though I am most comfortable
        with digital design. I use Krita on Windows and/or Procreate for iOS, depending on the commission type.
        <br>
