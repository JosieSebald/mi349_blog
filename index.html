        <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Minecraft</li>
            <li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
            <li>Stardew Valley</li>

        <p>The first game in my list is <strong>Minecraft</strong>, a cube-based sandbox game released in 2011- and I've been playing it since.
            Minecraft is the first major game that I played growing up, and it began my very invested hobby of playing video games that are 
            singeplayer and multiplayer.
            <br>
            The second game in my list is <strong>Left 4 Dead 2</strong>, a survival horror first-person shooter that can be played by yourself 
            or with friends. I choose to play this game with my friends, and I like it because it gives me an adrenaline rush and provides many
            different challenges and game modes- not to mention, killing zombies with a baseball bat is a great way to release anger.
            <br>
            The third and final game in my list is <strong>Stardew Valley</strong>, which is a simulation RPG. It is also a great game to play with
            friends; you can go mining, fishing, complete quests, participate in festivals, and many other things. It's a very friendly game
            and fun to look at.

        <h2>Favorite Music Genres</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Pop</li>
            <li>Rock</li>
            <li>Indie</li>
            </ul>

        <br>
        <p><strong>Pop</strong> is a favorite of mine because it is very upbeat and fun to dance to. It makes me feel very colorful and happy.
        <br>
        <strong>Rock</strong> is another great genre because I love the sounds of guitars and drums; I think they work very well together, and 
        they give off a sense of power and independence.
        <br>
        <strong>Indie</strong> is the other genre in this list and I love it because I get to hear voices from so many people that aren't typically
        mainstream. These independent artists have a lot to contribute and I think they should be showcased more often.

        <h2>Art Pieces</h2>
        <ul class="art">
            <li><img src="Classroom.png" alt="Rendered and textured 
                blend of my classroom in my senior year of high school.">Blender Rendered Classsroom, 2019</li>
            <li><img src="cat.png" alt="A digital drawing of a black 
                and brown cat sleeping in a group of pink clouds.">Cat Commission, 2021</li>
            <li><img src="nature_items.jpg" alt="A pencil drawing 
                of a pineapple, a romaine lettuce leaf, a pinecone, an artichoke and some sticks.">College Art Assignment, 2020</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>One of the images I'm most proud of is my <strong>Blender Classroom Render</strong>. I made this my senior year of high school for a VR game.
        I spent many months on it and it turned out great. It was a super fun project to work on and I hope that, in the future, I get to do
        something similar again!
        <br>
        Another image that I loved working on is my <strong>College Art Assignment</strong>. In this piece, we had to draw objects we were looking
        at, and they had to be objects from nature. Just the pineapple took about six hours, with the whole drawing taking about nine hours in total.
        Though it was a pain to draw, it was really fun and paid off in the end.  
        <br>
        Another great piece that I've produced is a <strong>Cat Commission</strong>, which is my most recent piece of work. This was commissioned to me
        by a friend, and the picture is an image of his cat sleeping in a group of pink clouds. This took some hours of work but I always enjoy
        working on digital art, so each moment was a good one.
